What this program does: 

This code uses a neural network to learn the sentiment of words and movie reviews, and then uses its knowledge to predict the sentiment of a new, user entered, movie review. 


How to use this program: 

To compile all the files, enter 'javac *.java' into the terminal.
To run the program, enter 'java MoviesMain' into the terminal.
You will be prompted to enter a movie review (this usually takes 45 to 75 seconds for the first review, and it gets faster after that). Enter the review by typing it into the terminal and pressing 'Enter'.
Wait for the program to predict the sentiment of your review. The predicted rating of your review will be displayed. 
You will be asked if you would like to run the program again. Enter your choice into the terminal. 


Other notes:

The prediction of the same review may vary in different runs of the program due to the variance in machine learning.
